1. `Title` is the page title. It **should be same as that of your Obsidian file** title for our Wiki links to work. i.e, if file is `credits.md` title has to be `credits`
2. If you want to show the note on the feed, you should set `Feed` as `show`. It's an optional value, and the default value is set to hide. (To avoid publishing by mistake)
3. `date` is used to sort note in feed. 
4. `permalink` is an optional value. Use it to set permanent URLs
5. `format:list` will change the layout to a list with border, Refer [[Credits]]. This is useful for Curated lists (Check [my personal library](https://hiran.in/list/reading) ) or while building MoC.
